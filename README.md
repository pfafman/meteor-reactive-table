Reactive Table
====================

Paging Table for Meteor.  Only downloads the current page to the client and also is set up for inline editing and a light schema.

## Installation

clone the git repo to your packages directory. Then ... 

```sh
    meteor add pfafman:reactive-table
```

Note this is not on Atmosphere yet due to alpha nature. 

##Usage

TODO:  Currently needs some TLC to get to work and I have not documented all the steps.  Look at the [test site code]() to get an idea of what this can do.
